# Blind_xpath_inject
Blind XPath Injection Script written in Python

This is a script I wrote to automatically extract information from an XML database. The script takes advantage of boolean logic by evaluating every character in a string as true or false to eventually guess the entire string. In this case the strings stored in the XML database were a `username` and `password`.
